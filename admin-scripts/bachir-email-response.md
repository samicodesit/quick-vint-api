**Subject:** Re: Subscription Plan Changes - Account Upgraded

Hi Bachir,

Thank you for reaching out and for being a valued customer of AutoLister AI.

I completely understand your frustration with the recent plan restructuring. You're absolutely right that when you subscribed, the terms were different, and I want to make this right for you.

**Here's what I'm doing immediately:**

✅ **I've upgraded your account to our Pro plan (40 listings/day) for the remainder of your current billing cycle** - this should give you much more flexibility for your clothing business.

✅ **This upgrade is complimentary** - you won't be charged extra until your next renewal on October 16th.

✅ **At renewal, you can choose** which plan works best for your needs going forward.

**About the bugs you mentioned:** I take this seriously and am actively monitoring system performance. If you experience any issues where the tool stops working before you've reached your daily limit, please let me know immediately with screenshots if possible, and I'll investigate and make it right.

**Moving forward:** I'm implementing better monitoring to prevent these kinds of service interruptions and to ensure fair usage limits.

I appreciate your patience during this transition, and I'm committed to making sure AutoLister AI helps your business succeed.

Best regards,  
[Your name]

P.S. - Your upgraded access should be active within the next few minutes. Please let me know if you have any other concerns!
